# ModifyBiomes

This plugin was made for internal purposes but its very small and simple
(how I really want it) so your welcome to fork it and modify it if you want to
change it for yourself to something else.

The BiomesMapping class does all the work, just use the API to replace biomes
as you see fit!

## How to develop and get it running

1. This is a NetBeans project, you of course need NetBeans
2. Modify the Ant based build.xml file to target the plugins folder for your
   minecraft server. Builds will automatically be placed there.

I take all the help I can get. Try to keep and encourage issues to be here so 
there in one place. Don't be afraid to open an issue just for collaboration with
me and others.
